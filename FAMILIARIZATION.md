# Codebase Familiarization Notes

## Repository Overview

This repository currently contains a single resource file (`README.md`) that curates a list of dashboard and visualization tools, organized into several categories (General, Graphite, Ganglia, InfluxDB, Sensu, and Others).

## Key Takeaways

- The project functions as an "awesome list" â€“ a curated set of links with short descriptions, rather than executable code.
- Contributions are expected to follow the contribution guidelines at the bottom of `README.md`.
- No build tooling, dependencies, or runtime code are present in the repository at this time.

## Suggested Next Steps for New Contributors

1. Review the existing entries in each category before proposing additions to avoid duplicates.
2. When adding new resources, ensure the format `- [Resource Name](URL) - Description.` is respected and that descriptions end with a period.
3. Consider expanding underrepresented sections (e.g., Ganglia or Sensu) with high-quality resources if available.
4. If the list grows substantially, evaluate whether additional categories or subcategories would improve discoverability.
