# Dashboard Sandbox MVP – Comprehensive Handover

This single document captures everything needed to understand, evaluate, and extend the dashboard sandbox that now lives inside the **awesome-dashboard** repository. It consolidates the former familiarization notes, MVP plan, documentation suite, and final PR brief into one place so future contributors never have to chase context across multiple files.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Purpose:** Provide an interactive, framework-free dashboard sandbox that demonstrates how to visualize a shared set of quarterly business metrics across multiple perspectives (revenue, marketing, product health) while remaining accessible, offline-friendly, and easy to iterate.
- **Intended audience:** Repository maintainers, contributors evaluating dashboard ideas, and reviewers who need a guided experience to validate proposed UI/UX changes.
- **Core outcomes:**
  - Guided, calm interface with a hero banner, sticky configuration rail, and reusable cards that keep context visible while switching dashboards.
  - Accessible data visualizations powered by Chart.js with progressive enhancement fallbacks (tables and lists) when scripts or CDN access are unavailable.
  - Narrative insights and CSV exports so stakeholders can capture the active dashboard view without backend services.
  - Deterministic Node-based smoke tests and CI workflow that confirm the MVP stays healthy before every merge.

## 2. Repository Orientation

| Path | Role | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Landing page | Points to the sandbox, explains how to run `npm run dev`/`npm test`, and links back to this handover for the full story. |
| `demo/index.html` | Application shell | Hero layout, skip link, `<noscript>` banner, configuration rail, reusable metric cards, insights panel, and CSV export control. |
| `demo/styles.css` | Visual system | CSS custom properties, responsive grid, focus styles, motion-reduction handling, card + table theming, and fallback styling. |
| `demo/data.js` | Datasets | Fictional quarterly data for revenue, marketing, and product health dashboards including chart series, summary metrics, segment mix, and narrative insights. |
| `demo/charts.js` | Chart utilities | Chart.js registration, palette tokens, dataset transforms, accessibility labeling, animation guards, and HTML fallbacks when charts are disabled. |
| `demo/utils.js` | Pure helpers | Selection normalization, CSV generation, copy helpers, number formatting, and snapshot builders consumed by both UI and tests. |
| `demo/app.js` | App controller | Wires DOM controls, persists selections via `localStorage`, orchestrates charts + fallbacks, renders summaries/insights, and drives CSV download flow. |
| `tests/dashboard.test.mjs` | Smoke suite | Exercises dataset integrity, default selections, summary rendering, insight feeds, CSV output, and fallback generation using Node’s built-in test runner. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Automation | Runs `npm test` on push/PR using Node 18 as defined by `.nvmrc`. |

## 3. MVP Goals & Guardrails

1. **Launchable in minutes** – Open `demo/index.html` directly or run `npm run dev` (Python static server helper) to explore locally; no bundlers or frameworks required.
2. **Scenario switching** – Dashboard dropdown and quarter selector dynamically populate from dataset metadata and keep badge labels, headings, and charts in sync.
3. **Understandable at a glance** – Hero copy, sticky rail, consistent card layout, and accessible focus/skip link patterns orient new viewers immediately.
4. **Actionable outputs** – CSV export packages chart series, summary metrics, and narrative insights along with dashboard metadata for quick sharing.
5. **Confidence in behavior** – Deterministic smoke tests and CI keep the MVP reliable; progressive enhancement ensures data visibility even without Chart.js.

### Simplifications that keep scope in check
- Single-page static app with synthetic data; no backend, authentication, or multi-page routing.
- Shared widget set (bar, line, doughnut, summary table, segment mix, insights list) reused across dashboards to avoid bespoke components per scenario.
- Vanilla CSS (no utility frameworks) so new contributors can tweak styling without build tooling.

### Risks & mitigations
- **Chart.js availability:** CDN failures detected at runtime; tables/lists render automatically so dashboards stay useful offline.
- **Storage limitations:** `localStorage` persistence is wrapped in safe accessors and degrades gracefully when unavailable.
- **Test drift:** Core logic remains in pure utilities (`demo/utils.js`) making it easy to unit test without browsers.

## 4. UX & Accessibility Highlights

- **Orientation experience:** Hero banner summarizes sandbox purpose, while the sticky rail keeps active dashboard/quarter, copy, and CSV controls visible on scroll.
- **Navigation aids:** Skip link jumps straight to the dashboard region; keyboard focus states are high-contrast and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` preferences.
- **Fallback content:** When Chart.js cannot initialize, metrics render as tables and lists styled to match the card aesthetic, ensuring numerical clarity.
- **Assistive support:** Insights feed uses `aria-live="polite"`, dropdowns and buttons include descriptive labels, and the `<noscript>` banner clarifies JavaScript requirements.

---

## 5. Data Model & Rendering Flow

1. `demo/data.js` exports a normalized `dashboards` map. Each entry defines:
   - `metadata` – labels, descriptions, and hero badge copy.
   - `quarters` – quarterly metric groups (summary table rows, line/bar series, segment mix).
   - `insights` – narrative bullet points per quarter for the highlights card.
2. `demo/utils.js` normalizes selection keys, formats numbers, and constructs CSV payloads and fallback markup fragments.
3. `demo/app.js` bootstraps on `DOMContentLoaded`:
   - Populates dashboard/quarter dropdowns.
   - Hydrates persisted selections (if available).
   - Calls `renderDashboardView`, which orchestrates:
     - Chart updates via `charts.js` helpers.
     - Summary table rendering with empty-state handling.
     - Segment mix list/table presentation.
     - Insights feed updates and CSV snapshot generation.
4. Users trigger updates by changing dropdowns or hitting the CSV button; state persists in `localStorage` for the next visit.

## 6. Tooling, Tests & Automation

- **Node toolchain** – `.nvmrc` pins Node 18; `package.json` scripts:
  - `npm run dev` → `python -m http.server --directory demo 4173` convenience alias for quick previews.
  - `npm test` → Node test runner executing `tests/dashboard.test.mjs`.
- **Smoke coverage** – Tests verify:
  - Default selections resolve to the revenue dashboard, current quarter, and expected summary metrics.
  - Chart data adapters produce correctly shaped datasets for bar, line, and doughnut widgets.
  - CSV export includes metadata, summary rows, and insight text.
  - Fallback HTML renders when Chart.js is unavailable.
- **CI workflow** – `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs dependencies and runs `npm test` on every push and pull request to enforce the MVP contract.

## 7. Local Evaluation Checklist

1. **Environment setup:** `nvm use` (or install Node 18) then `npm install` to fetch dev dependencies (none beyond Node core, but keeps scripts consistent).
2. **Smoke tests:** Run `npm test` to execute the deterministic suite.
3. **Manual verification:** `npm run dev` and open the printed localhost URL.
   - Switch between Revenue, Marketing, and Product Health dashboards; confirm cards, tables, insights, and badge text update.
   - Toggle quarters to validate chart + summary refresh.
   - Click **Download CSV** and inspect the file contents.
   - Temporarily block Chart.js (e.g., via network panel) to observe fallback tables/lists.
4. **Review notes for handoff:** Use this document’s sections 8–9 for PR talking points and follow-up ideas.

## 8. Final PR Talking Points

- MVP delivers a polished, accessible, multi-dashboard sandbox that runs from static assets.
- Charts enhance the experience but never block data visibility thanks to HTML fallbacks and `<noscript>` messaging.
- CSV export and persistent selections support reviewer workflows and iterative testing.
- Automated smoke tests and CI keep the experience dependable for future contributors.

---

## 9. Forward-Looking Recommendations

1. **Add visual regression tests** once CI resources allow (e.g., Playwright screenshots) to complement the Node smoke suite.
2. **Introduce schema validation** for datasets so expanding the dashboard library stays safe and consistent.
3. **Gather usability feedback** from contributors to prioritize enhancements like inline annotations or guided tours.
4. **Consider GitHub Pages deployment** after validating test coverage, providing a zero-setup preview environment.
