# MVP Final PR Summary

Use this outline when preparing the final pull request so reviewers can
quickly understand what shipped and how to validate it locally.

## Highlights

- **Multi-dashboard sandbox** – Revenue, marketing, and product views share the
  same responsive layout, with synchronized cards, charts, insights, and CSV
  exports.
- **Accessible by default** – Skip link, focus states, reduced-motion support,
  `<noscript>` messaging, and Chart.js fallbacks keep the experience usable even
  in constrained environments.
- **Modular architecture** – Data, chart configuration, and UI orchestration live
  in dedicated modules, making new dashboards or widgets straightforward to add.

## Local validation

1. Install Node.js 18.17+ (see `.nvmrc`).
2. Run `npm install` (only needed if dependencies change) and then `npm run dev`
   to serve the sandbox on http://localhost:4173.
3. Exercise the Dashboard and Quarter selectors, confirm insights update, and
   download a CSV snapshot to ensure the export wiring works.
4. Temporarily disable JavaScript or block Chart.js to observe the table/list
   fallbacks and the `<noscript>` banner.
5. Execute `npm test` to run the smoke suite and verify CI parity.

## Talking points for the PR description

- Call out the new user-facing widgets (insights stream, CSV export, empty-state
  messaging) and why they matter.
- Mention resilience improvements (localStorage persistence, accessibility,
  fallbacks) so reviewers know what to validate.
- Include an updated screenshot captured at 1440×900 highlighting populated
  charts or fallbacks, depending on the story you want to tell.
- Link to `docs/mvp_plan.md` and `docs/final_pr_checklist.md` for background and
  verification steps.

This document serves as a quick-reference so maintainers can assemble a thorough
pull request without re-reading every file in the repo.
